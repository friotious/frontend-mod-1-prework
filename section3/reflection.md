## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  - 1. Having a growth mindset is what will make you successful, not your current 'intelligence' level.  It is all about how you react to challenges and failures that will determine how you progress.
  - 2. Setting goals is important, the SMART system is new to me. but also looking back from where you've come
  can also be helpful.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

  - I do believe that I will improve over time depending on the time devoted as well as effort put in.  

  - I do not do a good job of specific goal setting, and I could do a better job of recognizing when to ask for help.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

  - When I use twitter, everytime you go to an accounts homepage you are presented with there info, name, handle, brief description, when they joined.  This is probably and array of elements attributed to an array attached to the user profile.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

  - An array method is a function that manipulates an array in some way.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

   - The purpose of a loop is to automate a process so that we don't have to write repetitive code.  
   -

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

  - Loops is like teaching yourself to walk.  At first you had to focus and tell your legs to talk each step, but now you do it without thinking about it.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

  - Can arrays hold infinite elements?
