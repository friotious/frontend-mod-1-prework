## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

  - The Pomodoro technique helped me walk away when having a challenge.  It also helped me stay focused for the time I alotted and not get distracted.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

  - My time estimates are waay off.  It is taking me longer than expected.  House/personal/family  stuff is taking longer than expected as well. But I did find myself more focused within the time that I had.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

  - An object is used to present the properties or values of a thing. These properties can be changed and added/subtracted.  An array is simply an ordered list of values.  

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - array.  It is a simple list.
  * List of states and their capitals - array. Also a simple list
  * List of things to pack for vacation - object. The items you pack may change depending on where you are vacationing
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - array. It's a list
  * List of student names and their cohort - array. It's a list
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - object. Ingredients and amounts may change depending on what kind of cake you are baking.
  * All my favorite restaurants - object. You could have properties of restaurant, takeout, how expensive, quality, location.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

  - So
