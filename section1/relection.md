## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  I would like to, and I will work to adopt this process and mindset.  I like the idea of learning as a process and not a destination.  You are never "done" so you don't have to worry about reaching the finish line, just keep doing the process.  I do like to read, althouh reading technical info will take some getting used to, and I am concious of taking care of my brain.  I want to work treating all challenges as a part of the process and growth of skills.  I should also remember to take short breaks.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

  - **Strings** - Any combo of letters, words, sentences, numbers as text (not as value). Also spaces and special characters.
  - **Numbers** - Any integer, postive, negative, or zero.  Plus decimals.
  - **Booleans** - data that has an answer, true or false!

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

  `console.log('"Hello World"')`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

  //  -  This is for a single line comment. It is used to clarify and/or make notes about your code to yourself or someone else.  It can also deactivate code you don't want to run yet.  You can use /*, */ to comment out more than one line.  

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

  A variable is a piece of data or information that you define so that you can refer back to it.  

  To a five year old...  You are going to pick a toy play with today.  You have 17 different stuffed rabbits.  You pick that really soft one with brown fur wearing the jacket with buttons.  If you and I are playing with it we can just call it "the rabbit" instead of calling it "that really soft one with brown fur wearing the jacket with buttons". "the rabbit" is the variable. ``

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

  - GoogleMaps - 1. var = nameOfDestination - String
                 2. var = distanceFromStartingPoint - Number
                 3. var = nameOfLocation - String

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

  Joining two or more data types together into a single string

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

  email app: name, email address, date, time listed at top of email.  

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)  

  I suck at typing.  Do you reccomend working on it specifically, or just letting it progress as it will considering I will be typing a lot?

  Is there a preferred method to add spaces? I notice a space will be added to a string right before the end of the quote, or sometimes it is put by itself in between quotes.  Seems like adding it to the string is less clutter.  Does it matter?    

  `console.log("The " + speedy + " jumped over the " + slowPoke)`
                            vs
  `console.log("The" + " " + speedy + " " + "jumped over the " + slowPoke)`
