## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

  I tend to find it difficult asking questions. I definitely wait too long.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

  This felt fine to me.  I had remembered how to do all that. I liked looking at outside resources.  Reading or hearing things explained in a slightly different way
  is helpful to solidify understanding.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

  - A conditional statement is code that has a decision for your code to do one thing, or another, or another, depending on the outcome of the condition.  
  - If I wanted to make breakfast, I would open the fridge and look for eggs, if I have eggs I make eggs for breakfast, if not I look for yogurt, If I have yogurt I have yogurt for breakfast, if I don't have yogurt, I get mad and then look for my wallet and keys.  
  - When you search for an artist on Spotify, if that specific artist is on Spotify, their profile shows up first, if not the closest alphabetical similar artist shows up.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

  - else if, followed by as many else if as you require conditions.
  - The program reads, if this statement is true, run the proceeding code contained within the curly brackets.  If the statement is false or condition is not met, move on to the next else if and see if that condition is true or met, if it is, run the code, and so on.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

  - && will check if 2 conditions are met, || will check if one of two is met. You could run just the conditional snippet in Repl.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

  It seems like these could get insanely complicated, is there a way to isolate them/more advanced code, or do you just get used to it?
